# Improved Scene Hierarchy
Unity's scene hierarchy window is quit boring. This is a package that I made by
following [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFh7tniBqkk). This
makes the first component excluding the Transform Component to use it as Icon
for the GameObject in the hierarchy.
