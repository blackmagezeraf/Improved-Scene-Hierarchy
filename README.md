# Improved Scene Hierarchy
Unity's scene hierarchy window is quit boring. This is a package that I made by
following [YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFh7tniBqkk). This
makes the first component excluding the Transform Component to use it as Icon
for the GameObject in the hierarchy.

## Installation
- Open Package Manager from Window>Package Manager
- Click `+` Icon Dropdown and select "Install Package from git url"
- Paste `https://github.com/blackmagezeraf/Improved-Scene-Hierarchy.git` in the url section of the package manager
- Press "Install" button located at the right end of the url text section.

### [NOTE]
> I will not be updating this package a lot or possibly EVER. You have been
> warned. Use it on your own discretion.

# Issues
